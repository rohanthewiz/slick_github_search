# Slick Github Search
A cool way to search for repositories on Github.

### Usage 
The app requires OAuth login to Github before searching.
Once logged in, you will be directed to the Search page.

Search by repository title and optionally computer language of the project.


### Roadmap
This was created as a demonstration project and is by no means complete.
Enjoy!
